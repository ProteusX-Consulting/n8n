#### OUR STORY

AV Chemist Story
----------------

Access to doctor-prescribed medications is essential to ensuring a faster healing process. However, due to working environments, disputes or litigation, local pharmacies have not been the most convenient place to get your workerâ€™s compensation medications.

Often, this results in delayed access to the right treatment, thus making it frustrating and a time-consuming process.

We decided to change that narrative.

To provide an effective solution that fastens the process, AV Chemist was born.
