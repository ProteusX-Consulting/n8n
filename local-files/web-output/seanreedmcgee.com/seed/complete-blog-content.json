      "content": "I am deeply honored to have received the **Walter S. McAfee Leadership Award from the Zeta Epsilon Lambda Chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity,** Inc. This award recognizes individuals who exemplify leadership and a steadfast commitment to uplifting our community.​\n\nAs part of this recognition, I have been privileged to contribute to the chapter's scholarship initiative, which awards $1,500 scholarships to five deserving high school students—both male and female—in Monmouth and Ocean counties. This program is a cornerstone of our efforts to promote academic excellence and provide meaningful support to local youth.​\n\nThe award is named in honor of Dr. Walter S. McAfee, a pioneering African American physicist and mathematician. Dr. McAfee made history in 1946 by providing the theoretical calculations that enabled Project Diana—the first successful attempt to bounce radar signals off the Moon and receive the reflected signals back on Earth. This groundbreaking achievement marked the beginning of radar astronomy and laid the foundation for the U.S. space program.​\n\nDr. McAfee's legacy serves as a powerful reminder of the impact that dedication, intellect, and perseverance can have on both science and society. It is a profound privilege to be associated with an award that bears his name and to continue the work of empowering the next generation of leaders and innovators.",

      "content": "LANHAM, Md., Jan. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — MedCerts, a nationally recognized leader in online healthcare and IT career training, and FocusQuest LLC, a passionate advocate for student success and educational access, are thrilled to launch a progressive partnership designed to provide minority students with expanded access to high-demand career pathways. In honor of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s legacy, MedCerts is proud to announce this collaboration with FocusQuest, whose partnerships with Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) have supported more than 80,000 African American students in achieving their goals and advancing educational equity.\n\n**FocusQuest** will offer minority students – spanning both high school and college levels – flexible allied health and IT training opportunities that lead to nationally recognized certifications. By equipping students with the skills to thrive in rapidly growing industries, this initiative leads the way for rewarding and stable careers while helping to alleviate critical workforce shortages.\n\n\"We strive to connect minority students with exceptional health-industry education,\" said **Sean-Reed McGee, CEO of FocusQuest.** \"These programs offer life-changing opportunities to pursue careers many students may not have thought possible.

      "content": "**What defines our success?** Success is as **unique** as each of the 8 billion individuals on this planet. But who determines when we've reached our **goals**? We do! I've come to realize that success and its various levels are measured by what matters most to us **personally**. What are you aiming for?\n\nTake **Steve Jobs**, the visionary behind **Apple**. He achieved great success, yet in his final days, he would have traded much of it for what he had sacrificed – his **health**.\n\nSo, is success measured by finances, properties, health, education, spiritual awareness, or family bonds? I'd argue it's a **balance** of all these and more. We should strive for each, understanding that some may require more attention than others on any given day.\n\nThe key is accurately assessing what success means to us. Sometimes, it might be as simple as enjoying two hours on the beach, watching a sunrise or sunset. That's success for the day. Life is filled with beautiful moments we often overlook.\n\n**Exposure** and **continuous learning** are fundamental to nearly every level of success, regardless of the category. In exposing ourselves to new moments, new **experiences** we can build our own library of **personal success**. So keep learning, and never stop. Your journey to success is uniquely yours – embrace it, shape it, and celebrate each **milestone** along the way.\n\n**_Sean-Reed McGee_**\n\n**_FocusQuest – Chief Executive Officer_**",

      "content": "My jaw dropped as I saw the **video**. How could this happen again? How could another **unarmed person of color** be violently **shot** in the head? Why would a person feel so threatened by water from 20 feet away that they would fire their gun? I'm sure many people feel the horror and other emotions flowing as their brains are filled with countless questions. One of my answers is the \"**lack of comfort with those who don't share the same ethnic background**.\"\n\nHow can we continue to expand our thoughts and actions to reflect just being more **human** to others? In our **workplace**, in our **community**, in our **industry**, can we just continue to embrace each other as fellow humans? To know that the person in front of us may not look like a member of our immediate family, yet they too are special, deserving of grace and consideration. In fact, they could be a member of our family or team.\n\nEach day I'm challenged to know that **tomorrow** is not promised and that someone may choose to be uncomfortable simply because I don't remind them of… or I don't sound like them. We are all different and special in our own ways. Not better and not worse, until proven without **biased cause**. How can we grow to become more comfortable with everyone around us? Or do we just learn to become comfortable with being uncomfortable, until we know more?\n\nAs we **celebrate** the **4rd anniversary of BiPM**, we are encouraged that collectively we are **making a difference** in this small space of the big world. Over the past **4 years**, we have grown tremendously to over **505 members and allies**, attended **43 events**, and are planning our first **BiPM summit** in January. While our numerical growth is impressive, it's crucial that we also focus on **growing in wisdom and understanding**. I'm looking forward to knowing more, today and tomorrow, to learn more about those individuals who don't look like me. To see what they can offer, to understand how I can grow through my experiences with them.\n\n**Let's all continue to grow and become better.**",

      "content": "_**Dad**,_\n\n_Where do I start? How can I accurately tell the world your **journey**? Let me tell the parts that I know, the moments that you impressed upon me and the **emotions** that we battled with to do our best to win._\n\n_Born on August 4, 1950, my dad **Larry Reed McGee** was born to my **grandfather Reed McGee**, who passed when you were twelve, and **Vera (Carter) McGee**; in New York. As the youngest of three children, with two older sisters, **Marge and Barbara**, maybe you felt a desire to prove that you could bear the weight of being the \"**man of the house**\" who would need to step up and in. Did you spend your whole life trapped trying to prove yourself while wanting just to be free?_\n\n_Until this day I'm not sure if you grew up in the **Bronx or Brooklyn** while being born in money making **Manhattan**, but I do know that you were and will always be a lover of all things New York –**Go Yankees**!! **Long Island, NY** is where your mastery of handball created memories for me trying to compete with you as you ran me all over the court._\n\n_You never spoke much about your education after high school, but what is burnt into my head was that you had **2.5 PHDs in life**. A life filled with you grinding in entrepreneurial opportunities from **car washing** to **plastic manufacturing**. You would often bring me the interesting plastic \"toys\" from caps to combs to hangers to shoe horns to stuff that you had no idea what it was. I smiled wide knowing that you cared enough to mark those items on the inventory sheet as damaged so that I could have them._\n\n_Dad, you were a loner by nature who loved telling about your adventures with **Bob and Bobby and Marion and Audrey and others**. You were famous for finding a few people in a crowd to share your stories, which created new friends. **Facebook** will miss your shenanigans. However, you had that core crew of **5-7 friends**, for **50+ years**, which we all wish to have in our final days. To know that someone out here has your back through all of your craziness and intoxicated evenings is comforting. That's a deeper love that I hope to confirm for me and my people. **Priceless**._\n\n_You were married to my mom, **Reatha Cherry McGee** and we lived in **Roosevelt, Long Island** for a few years. Those couple of years must have broke the mold for you because you never completed the acts again. No siblings for me, unless…. Any hand raisers? You also never remarried, although you did manage to reopen your heart once or twice over the years. Oh how I wish that you had been able to find that ONE who could help heal your wounds. Wounds that you covered with escapes both internally in your mind as a professional **aggregator** and externally with trips, stumbling from landing to landing._\n\n_**God** gave me the gift of you for so many reasons. Your absence, constant work effort, hustle, ability to speak the truth, while keeping secrets as to why you left me at the age of two. It wasn't what I thought and wonder how life would have been if I knew earlier. I better now understand your battles. You best played the hand you were dealt and built on what you understood. I wish I could have convinced you that we were ideal teammates, if you would have just chose to allow me to be your proud legacy, as we created our joint victory. I would have loved to fulfill my God given part, as your buddy; your son._\n\n_Dad, you were the **life of the party**. Your presence was known, heard and seen making those around you laugh. You weren't the dancer, but you could tear up a debate and a two-step on most **Fox News** items. You enjoyed disrupting my day and night with breaking political news._\n\n_Your deeper joys circled around my girls, your daughter-in-law, **Wileeta Cheresse McGee** and grandchildren, **Dejah, Destiny and Desirae**. These were the only people on this planet that I knew who could make him stop in place to say **I love you**. These ladies also extended their love to you by watching over their **Gramps** and chuckled by the thought of what they did to protect you from himself. Oh how you treasured those afternoons of **BurgerKing Wednesday** with your grandbabies._\n\n_For years I desired to run and be nothing like you and now I look into the mirror to see you. How is that possible?_\n\n_**Dad was living in Jacksonville FL and you left us on June 26, 2024, at 73. He laid down on his bed, sent a few texts then left us. He found his peace, crossed his arms and finally didn't have to fight any battles.**_\n\n**_I want to THANK anyone and everyone who was a part of my dad's story. He thoroughly enjoyed, hated, and loved us all._**\n\n**_It will be my pleasure to close out my dad's journey with a final trip to Mexico._**\n\n_..Dad, while we will soon take one last trip together, to the place that you asked to escape too for years. Your buddy is here and prepared to carry you to the spot that you wished to find your **eternal freedom**._\n\n**_Dad, Thank you for everything I love you._**",
