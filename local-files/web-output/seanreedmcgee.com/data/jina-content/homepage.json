ABOUT SEAN
----------

God Made + Self-Perseverance

Sean grew up as an only child in a single-parent household, raised by his mother with the support of his grandmother and aunt. They were part of the lower-middle class and faced financial challenges. Despite their struggles, Sean’s mother was determined to provide him with the best education possible. She was resourceful, finding creative ways to secure discounts and scholarships for private schools. From a young age, Sean understood that his responsibility was to maintain the grades required to stay enrolled.

At 13, Sean began working at McDonald’s, cleaning floors. One of the most valuable lessons he learned there was the principle of “clean as you go,” a philosophy he still applies today. That lesson shaped his approach to becoming a self-starter—being proactive and ensuring projects are seen through to completion, no matter the challenges along the way.

Sean’s entrepreneurial spirit emerged in middle school and stayed with him through high school, where he built friendships with peers whose parents weren’t defined by traditional corporate roles. Many held upper-level positions or owned companies—leaders among leaders. These early experiences gave Sean a glimpse of what he wanted: the freedom and wealth he observed in his friends’ families.

When Sean entered college, he already had a clear sense of his aspirations. He knew he wanted the independence and success he had admired growing up.

Sean attributes his ability to overcome life’s challenges to being God-made, relying on a positive attitude, disciplined work ethic, and the right perspective to guide him through every stage of his journey.
