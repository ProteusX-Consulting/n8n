ABOUT SEAN
----------

Sean is an only child and grew up single-parent household with his mother and the help of his grandmother and aunt. They were not well off and were a part of the lower middle class. Despite their financial struggles, Sean’s mother was determined to give him the best education. She was creative in finding ways to get discounts and scholarships to private schools. Early on, **Sean understood his job and responsibility was to maintain the grade point average needed to stay in school.**

At the age of 13, Sean worked at McDonald’s cleaning floors. One of the biggest lessons he learned was **‘clean as you go’**, which is a lesson that follows him until this day. This lesson helped him perfect the skills of being a self-starter, being proactive, and following projects through to completion regardless of his challenges.

Sean’s desire for entrepreneurship began when he was in middle school and followed him through high school, where he became friends with individuals whose parents were not defined by their corporate jobs. They all had upper-level corporate positions or owned companies. They were major bosses among bosses. When Sean got to college, he had a good feeling about what he wanted – **to have the freedom and wealth he had seen growing up**.

Sean understands that first, he is **God-made** and was able to overcome life’s challenges by maintaining a positive attitude, disciplined work ethic, and the right perspective.

**Building a great legacy starts with family**

Sean married his better half, Wileeta McGee, at the ages of 22 and 19 which allowed them to grow up together, build a solid foundation, and determine their definition of success. Wileeta supported his passion for entrepreneurship from the beginning of their relationship, which allowed him to pursue his passion. Growing up without a father, Sean’s passion extended to his family. It was and still is important for him to be a devoted, caring, and loving husband to Wileeta, to be the best father to his three beautiful girls, and to be the man who showed up for his friends. His daughters taught him patience, to be a better listener, and to flow with a different swag.Dejah, his eldest daughter, made him focus.Destiny, his middle daughter, opened his eyes. And,Desirae, his youngest daughter,ma de him smile. “My daughters, combined, made me laugh with fulfillment.” Sean’s grand twins (Dior & Davis) and Demi are the newest and most precious gift of a never-ending source of joy.

“Dad,

Where do I start? How can I accurately tell the world your journey? Let me tell the parts that I know, the moments that you impressed upon me and the emotions that we battled with to do our best to win…”
