I am deeply honored to have received the **Walter S. McAfee Leadership Award from the Zeta Epsilon Lambda Chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity,** Inc. This award recognizes individuals who exemplify leadership and a steadfast commitment to uplifting our community.​

As part of this recognition, I have been privileged to contribute to the chapter’s scholarship initiative, which awards $1,500 scholarships to five deserving high school students—both male and female—in Monmouth and Ocean counties. This program is a cornerstone of our efforts to promote academic excellence and provide meaningful support to local youth.​

The award is named in honor of Dr. Walter S. McAfee, a pioneering African American physicist and mathematician. Dr. McAfee made history in 1946 by providing the theoretical calculations that enabled Project Diana—the first successful attempt to bounce radar signals off the Moon and receive the reflected signals back on Earth. This groundbreaking achievement marked the beginning of radar astronomy and laid the foundation for the U.S. space program.​

Dr. McAfee’s legacy serves as a powerful reminder of the impact that dedication, intellect, and perseverance can have on both science and society. It is a profound privilege to be associated with an award that bears his name and to continue the work of empowering the next generation of leaders and innovators.
