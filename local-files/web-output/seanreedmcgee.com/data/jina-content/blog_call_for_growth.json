My jaw dropped as I saw the**video**. How could this happen again? How could another**unarmed person of color**be violently**shot**in the head? Why would a person feel so threatened by water from 20 feet away that they would fire their gun? I’m sure many people feel the horror and other emotions flowing as their brains are filled with countless questions. One of my answers is the “**lack of comfort with those who don’t share the same ethnic background**.”

How can we continue to expand our thoughts and actions to reflect just being more**human**to others? In our**workplace**, in our**community**, in our**industry**, can we just continue to embrace each other as fellow humans? To know that the person in front of us may not look like a member of our immediate family, yet they too are special, deserving of grace and consideration. In fact, they could be a member of our family or team.

Each day I’m challenged to know that**tomorrow**is not promised and that someone may choose to be uncomfortable simply because I don’t remind them of… or I don’t sound like them. We are all different and special in our own ways. Not better and not worse, until proven without**biased cause**. How can we grow to become more comfortable with everyone around us? Or do we just learn to become comfortable with being uncomfortable, until we know more?

As we**celebrate**the**4rd anniversary of BiPM**, we are encouraged that collectively we are**making a difference**in this small space of the big world. Over the past**4 years**, we have grown tremendously to over**505 members and allies**, attended**43 events**, and are planning our first**BiPM summit**in January. While our numerical growth is impressive, it’s crucial that we also focus on**growing in wisdom and understanding**. I’m looking forward to knowing more, today and tomorrow, to learn more about those individuals who don’t look like me. To see what they can offer, to understand how I can grow through my experiences with them.

**Let’s all continue to grow and become better.**
